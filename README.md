# Lunar-lander-simulation

We design soft-landing system for lunar-lader to achieve trageted point with minimized fuel.

This system is consist of four sections:

1. Guidance
2. Attitude controller
3. 6-dof simulation

## Guidance
We solve trajectory optimization problem using gradient descent convex optimization method.
