# Lunar-lander-simulation


This project aims at the design of landing system for lunar lander to achieve soft precision landing to a desired landing site.

Trajectories have been optimized for fuel performance. We solved the convex optimization problem for minimum fuel using gradient descent method.

We designed an attitude control loop to align the lunar-lander in the direction of acceleration calculated from guidance. 

In addition, performance was verified through 6dof simulation.

All of the above processes were performed in Matlab.
